# CVE MCP server

This is an MCP server that can return details about a CVE ID. We will read the JSON from a checkout of the cve5 github repo

`git clone https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelistV5.git`

To run the server

`uv run cve-mcp-server.py`

Then you can run the client with

`uv run demo-client.py`


Here's an example interaction

```
uv run demo-client.py

Enter your message: Does CVE-2025-3000 affect OpenSSL?

User:  Does CVE-2025-3000 affect OpenSSL?

Since this CVE affects PyTorch and not OpenSSL, there is **no direct impact on OpenSSL** based on the data available for CVE-2025-3000. If you need further details about potential indirect effects or if there are other related vulnerabilities that could affect OpenSSL indirectly (e.g., through dependencies), please let me know!
